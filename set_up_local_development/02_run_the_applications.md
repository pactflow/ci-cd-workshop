## 2. Run the app and API

Start up the provider API by running `npm run start`.

Open a separate terminal for the consumer.

Before starting the consumer, export the location of the API by running:

`export REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080`

Then run:

`npm run start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You should see a list of products.
