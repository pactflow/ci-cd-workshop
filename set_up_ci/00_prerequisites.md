- [ ] [Node](https://nodejs.org/) 10 or thereabouts.
- [ ] [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- [ ] A [Github](http://github.com/) account.

- [ ] A Pactflow account. Sign up for a free developer account [here](https://pactflow.io/pricing/).

:warning: Note: these instructions have been written for, and tested, in a bash shell on Mac. They should work correctly on Linux. If you are using Windows, then you will need to know how to run git/make/node CLI commands, or pair with someone who does.
