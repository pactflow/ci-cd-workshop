## Strategies for verifying feature pacts

When a new "feature" pact is created, there are a few ways you could bring that pact into the verification process so that the verification results get published back to Pactflow from your CI.

1. Manually set and commit the name of the tag in the consumerVersionTags. eg `['feat/new-field', 'master', 'prod']` and then remove it once the feature is released.
    * This does the job, but there are better options.
1. Make a matching feature branch in the provider, and dynamically fetch the pact for the matching consumer branch. eg. `consumerVersionTags: [process.env.TRAVIS_BRANCH, 'master', 'prod']`    * This is a reasonably common approach, where the two teams coordinate feature development using matching branch names.
    * Tags will be deduped by the verification task, so it doesn't matter if you're already on master. If there's no pact with the name of the provider's branch, it won't raise an error.
1. Enable 'work in progress' pacts'

### Work in progress pacts

A "work in progress" pact is a pact that is the latest for its tag that does not have any successful verification results. At this stage in the exercise, the `feat/new-field`
