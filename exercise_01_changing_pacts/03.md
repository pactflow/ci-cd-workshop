## Making changes on a branch; or, how NOT to break everything

When we made first made the change to the pact on the master branch of the consumer, we ended up with broken consumer and provider builds, stopping them both from releasing. In the previous step, we learned how to configure the provider so that it could still continue to be released, even if it was not able to successfully verify the new pact.

The consumer is still unable to make a release from master however, as the `can-i-deploy` step correctly identifies that the verification for the `master` pact has failed.

Let's make our changes on a branch this time.

1. Revert the change to master and push to make the build go green again.

    ```
    git revert HEAD
    git push
    ```

1. Create a new branch

    ```
      git checkout -b feat/new-field
    ```

1. Add the new field again (e.g. `color: "red"`), and update the `expect(product).toStrictEqual` to expect the new field and value.

1. Make sure the tests pass locally by running `make test`.

1. Push your changes by running `git push --set-upstream origin feat/new-field`.
    * The consumer build will pass, as we don't deploy from non-master branches, so `can-i-deploy` won't run.
    * The webhook-triggered pact verification build will still fail - that's ok, as it doesn't stop the provider from deploying.


### Conclusion

By publishing pacts with tags, and configuring the provider to verify the tag that belongs to your main line of development (eg. `master` or `develop`) you keep your release pipelines green.
